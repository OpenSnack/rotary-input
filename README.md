# rotary-input

~~I have no idea why I made this.~~ This incredible idea came to me in a dream. It will revolutionize text input.

## Try it for some reason

`npm i`, `npm run build`, then point a server at `example/`.

The example configuration strings hexadecimal together to make Unicode characters. Try 263A!
